 <h2>Welcome!</h2>
   <p>Welcome to Non-Singular, we are a website that promotes the production of new games and new developers by having people find new games that they might like, like our best seller_______. We not only just sell best seller, but also new games that the avrage single developer. This is a great place to not only build up a portfolio, but also to find new partners, new intrest, and most of all new passion in the development of games. This website was built around the premis that the now avrage game developer has trouble marketing their games because there is no adiqut platfrom to do this on. You could maket your game on a webste like newground but that woun't beable to support you bank acount. It is also very hard to make a advertisement on youtube or other social media to get people exceited about your one game that wasn't even made by a AAA coumpny, so we do it for you! Since me the creator is also a game developer my self, the best part about this website is the marketing is entirely free, no weekly/mounthly revenew is needed to post your game (and a possible demo to wet the appitite) on this website! But I do kindly ask you to support me on patrion so that I can be alive enough to run this website, also please spred the word around about this website, I hope this will become a place where not only the developers and youtubers come to try new games, but also the avrage joe who is out there on their computer, tying to find a game that almost perfectly sutes their play style.</p>
